Expected inputs concatOdds ([4, 2, 2], [8, 6, 8, 10, 4, 12, 6]) to be ("Error: Please input odd numbers")

Functional Test:A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest. -->
<!-- At checkout it prompts user with three options ("Would you like to Sign in?"), ("Create a New Account?"), or ("Continue as Guest?") -->

<!-- Before paying if the user is logged in at checkout it will prompt the user ("Would you like to use the card XXXX on the account?") -->
 <!-- Before paying if the user is not logged in it will prompt the user ("insert or tap to pay") -->
